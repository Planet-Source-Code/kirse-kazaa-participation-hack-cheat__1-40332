A few general premonitions:
==================================================
1) This program will suck up any free CPU cycles
2) This program creates a load of hard drive activity
3) Big files (MPEGS, EXES, ISOS)... 1/2 gig or greater may cause your system to really slow down depending on CPU, RAM, etc.
4) It was hacked out in like 20 minutes, so don't expect anything great... except your participation level to increase!
==================================================

THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS FOR KAZAA 2.0
THEIR LATEST VERSION (2.01 AND GREATER) HAS ELIMINATED THIS HACK FROM WORKING ANYMORE...

================== NOTE ======================
If the program stops in the middle of its transfer, I've resolved that 90% of the time that the buffer size is set too high - so set it lower foo!  If you set the program to only transfer mp3s, a value of 4096 is good - 8192 is pushing it though...
============================================== 

Much thanks to the creater of that http download control...
